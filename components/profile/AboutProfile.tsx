      <p className="text-neutral-500">
        Hello! I’m Mirza Husic, a frontend developer and Odoo ERP specialist
        with over 3 years of experience in the IT sector. Currently based in
        Doha, Qatar, I work at Techman Solutions, where I help businesses
        streamline operations with custom ERP solutions tailored to their needs.
        With a strong focus on React, Next.js, and intuitive UI design, I bring
        a blend of technical skill and creativity to each project, always aiming
        for efficient, user-friendly solutions.
        <br /> <br />
        My journey has been defined by a love for problem-solving and continuous
        learning. I’ve collaborated on projects like Pickleball.com, building
        responsive, user-centric interfaces, and I’m currently deepening my
        expertise in Docker and backend technologies to further expand my
        development toolkit. Outside of work, you’ll find me exploring the
        latest tech trends or diving into my next creative project. I’m always
        eager to connect with others in the field—let’s build something great
        together!
